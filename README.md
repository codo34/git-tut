# git-tut
A repository for practicing on.

This README is where you can find information about the repository, the software or other content it contains, how to build the project from code, or how to use the software or other content.

You can use markdown to format it better. I don't know how to use markdown, but markdown is a way of easily formatting documents. It's not important to know markdown in order to use git or github.
